2. **Smooth Flow**
   - Practice the questions beforehand
   - No internet needed - demo mode works offline!
   - Have backup screenshots just in case

3. **Highlight Technical Aspects**
   - Mention RAG architecture design
   - Explain the demo mode approach
   - Emphasize upgrade path to production
   - Show the tech stack and clean code

### Questions You Might Face

**Q: Why did you choose this agent?**
A: HR queries are common, relatable, and demonstrate intelligent automation well. The problem is clear and the solution is measurable.

**Q: Why demo mode instead of live AI?**
A: Demo mode allows instant responses without API costs, perfect for demonstration. The architecture is designed to easily upgrade to live AI (LangChain + OpenAI/Gemini) for production.

**Q: How does the matching work?**
A: The system uses intelligent keyword matching to find the most relevant pre-configured response from the knowledge base, ensuring accurate answers based on actual HR documents.

**Q: What if the answer isn't in the knowledge base?**
A: The agent provides a helpful default response suggesting which topics it can help with, and recommends contacting HR for specific cases.

**Q: How would you scale this?**
A: Upgrade to LangChain with vector databases (FAISS), implement caching, add load balancing, and integrate with live AI APIs for semantic search.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: All processing is done locally. For production, we can use private LLM deployments or ensure data encryption.

**Q: How do you handle document updates?**
A: Currently manual update of responses. Future: automated pipeline that processes new documents and updates the knowledge base.
